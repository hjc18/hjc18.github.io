# About Me
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Wenjian Yu](https://numbda.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.html). 

My research interests lie in numerical algorithms, parallel computing, and machine learning for [electronic design automation (EDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation).

My name in Chinese: 黄杰辰.
